Fix Postgres and Synapse Media `storageClassName` configuration not being respected.

**Warning** Previously `synapse.media.storage.storageClass` and `postgres.storage.storageClass`
were in the values file and associated schema. These values were accidentally silently ignored
and all chart-managed `PersistentVolumeClaims` were constructed without `spec.storageClassName`
set, using the cluster default `StorageClass`.

The values file and associated schema have been updated so that the values are now
`synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` and `postgres.storage.storageClassName`. The previous
values are disallowed by the schema. Setting these values after the initial install could 
cause the `PersistentVolumeClaims` to be recreated, with associated data-loss. Only set
`synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` or `postgres.storage.storageClassName` on initial
installation.
